  <b>Issue Visualizer</b>
</h1>

The Issue Visualizer app is a platform to search issues from any publicly accessible github repo. Just type a repo name, and you'll get all available issues in a material-styled, paginated table.

#### User interaction:

- Type the full github repo name in the search input (ex. mojombo/bert), and click the "search" button for displaying the available issues
- If the selected repo does not exist, or requires authentication (private repos), a snackbar alert will be displayed
- The search input has a required validation control. If left in blank, a validation error will be displayed below the input
- Once the repo issues have been searched, it is possible to navigate the results through the pagination at the bottom-right of the table
